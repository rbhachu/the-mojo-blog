## Description
<p>A simple React.js Blog using custom hooks, with a REST API connected to a JSON Server. Plus pagination and redirects from React Router Dom.</p>

## Features
**Project features:**
  <ul>
    <li>View All Posts</li>
    <li>View Single Post via page link</li>
    <li>Create New Post</li>
    <li>Delete Post</li>        
  </ul>

## Dependencies/NPM Modules
<p>The following dependencies are required to run this project;</p>

[React v17.02 *](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) - Used for site framework with React Hooks. Fetch to connect to REST API and convert to useable JSON format.<br>
[React Router Dom v5.2.0 *](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) - Used for Pagination and History<br>
[JSON Server (Local) **](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) - Used to run a local machine version of the JSON API Server.<br>
[Heroku (Remote) **](https://elements.heroku.com/buttons/eecs130/json-server-heroku) - Used to run and host a remote version of the JSON API Server via Heroku servers (free too!).<br><br>
*_Installed automatically_<br>
**_Requires seperate manual installation_


## Installation Instructions
<p>Open your Code Editor and 'CD' into your working directory, then download the repo.<p>

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rbhachu/the-mojo-blog.git
```
<p>Once the repo has been downloaded, install it.<p>

```sh
npm install
```

<p>You then need to decide weather to run JSON server via your 'Local Machine' or 'Remotely' via Heorku servers.<p>


### JSON Server via Local Machine
<p>To run the 'Local Machine' version of JSON Server you first need to install JSON Server.</p>
<br>

Reference: [JSON Server NPM Module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server)

```sh
$ npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000
```
<ul>
  <li>--watch : path to JSON file in project for JSON server to monitor (data/db.json)</li>
  <li>--port : port to run JSON Server (8000 is used, so it does not conflict with REACT's  default port of '3000' which is used to run site.). You can change this port if you have issues to another number that is not 3000.</li>
</ul>
<br>

__.env file__<br>
Situated in the root of the project is the .env file. This file contains settings for JSON Server.

To run and use JSON Server locally, ensure the following is set (changing the port number '8000' if you use a different value).

````
# JSON SERVER LOCAL
REACT_APP_API_PATH="http://localhost:8000/blogs"

# JSON SERVER REMOTE
# REACT_APP_API_PATH="https://blooming-lowlands-04146.herokuapp.com/blogs"
````
__Package.json__

  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },
````

### JSON Server via Heroku Remote Server
<p>To use the remote version of JSON Server, follow the instructions from Heroku here.</p>

<p>In step 2 of the instructions from Heroku, use the db.json file from this repo as a template, sitated at '/data/db.json/'</p>

The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.",
